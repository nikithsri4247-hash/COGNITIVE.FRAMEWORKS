# Operational Commitment Model

## Problem

When multiple interpretations of a situation exist, individuals may delay action due to uncertainty.

## Tradeoff

High fluidity:
+ avoids premature conclusions  
- prevents behavioral commitment  

Rigidity:
+ enables action  
- risks incorrect assumption  

## Working Concept

Operational commitment involves temporarily prioritizing one interpretation for action while retaining alternatives as dormant hypotheses.

## Application

- Decision making under ambiguity  
- Social interpretation  
- Strategic planning  

## Limitations

- May fail under rapidly changing contexts  
- Requires periodic reassessment
